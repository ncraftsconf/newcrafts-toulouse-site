                <p>
                    Created by developers for developers, NewCrafts is an independent and international event on software development held annually in Paris and Bordeaux.<br/>
				</p>
				<p>
					Because we believe it is not enough for code to work, we want to question the way we develop, how we perceive our profession and craft.<br/>
				</p>
				<p>
					For the 6th edition, we've planned two days of advanced talks, hands-on labs and open-session spaces accessible all day !<br/>
				</p>
				<p>
					You might also be interested by pre-conference workshops by our renowned speakers on Wed. 15th of May. More info soon.<br/>

                <p class="about">
                    I ended up as a Software Developer, I am pretty sure there was no other viable option. My current technical interests are F#, games, programming languages and philosophy of computing .

                    I really enjoy finding different ways to write code, sometimes for performance, other times for succinctness, sometimes, just because you can, there is no better way to learn than trying.
                    
                    When I am not working I tend to play with other languages or cats
                    
                    Conferences and meetups are a great way to learn more, so I try to help when I can to make them happen. For that reason I co-organise Functional Kats and GameCraft. I also speak at local and international conferences like CodeMesh, Progressive.Net, ProgF#, Lambda Days and many more.

                    Born into an aristocratic Russian-German family, Bodil traveled widely around the Soviet Union as a child. Largely self-educated, she developed an interest in computer science during her teenage years. According to her later claims, in 1989 she embarked on a series of world travels, visiting Europe, the Americas, and India. She alleged that during this period she encountered a group of mathematical adepts, the "Haskell Language and Library Committee," who sent her to Glasgow, Scotland, where they trained her to develop her powers of category theory. Both contemporary critics and later biographers have argued that some or all of these foreign visits were fictitious, and that she spent this period writing JavaScript.
